**[🔴 View Live Demo Here](https://hirehook.onrender.com/)**

A premium, modern front-end marketing website designed for a fictional tech recruitment platform. This project focuses heavily on UI/UX principles, modern aesthetics, and high performance without relying on heavy front-end frameworks.

## Features
* **Performant Scroll Animations:** Uses the native JavaScript `IntersectionObserver` API to trigger elegant, lightweight fade-up animations as the user scrolls down the page.
* **Interactive 3D Elements:** Features a dynamic 3D perspective hover effect on the hero image engineered using advanced CSS transforms.
* **Modern CSS Architecture:** Utilizes CSS Grid to build complex responsive sections (like the multi-tiered pricing tables) and CSS backdrop-filters for a frosted-glass sticky navigation bar.
* **Fully Responsive:** Adapts flawlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5** (Semantic markup)
* **CSS3** (Advanced Transforms, Grid, Flexbox)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (Intersection Observer API)

## Key Learnings
Building this taught me how to create professional-grade animations without relying on heavy libraries like GSAP or AOS. By utilizing the `IntersectionObserver`, I ensured the animations only run when the elements are actually visible on the screen, heavily optimizing the site's performance.
